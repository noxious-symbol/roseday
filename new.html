          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.Like a rose in full
          bloom, your presence warms up my heart. The red roses reflect the
          passion that burns inside my soul for you, while the white ones signify the purity of
          our love. In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Thank you for being my love, happiness ,admiration  and inspiration. Our journey
          together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses or I should say as sweet as my sweet. Happy Rose Day, my
          love. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
